1)	Generally, I lean towards a phased, step by step approach to migration. Since this project is tiny, doesn’t have any tests, uses outdated tech stacks, and most of the coding is poor, I decided to recreate the project from scratch.
2)	I used Github as Resource Server (Oauth2) to save some time.
3)	Duplicate Cake entries are flagged with a warning in the log instead of throwing an exception. The feature needs to be refined further to understand how to handle it better.
4)	New application is built using latest tech stack, namely,
    a.	Spring Boot
    b.	Spring Rest
    c.	Spring Data
    d.	Feign Client
    e.	Spring Security
    f. 	etc
5)	The frontend is a simple mock implementation to showcase the integration via Rest calls. I didn’t bother adding any test to it. Ideally, it should be built using proper frontend tools.
6)	Further, I kept all the styles and script in the same file.
7)	I carried over the same length constraints from the old Cake entity to the new one.
8)	Since there is no Babel, I refrained from using any ES6 syntax for backward browser compatibility.
9)	The rest of the changes should be self-explanatory.
10) Please refer to README.md for more information.
